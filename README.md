# Koha Search vs Custom Fuzzy Reranking â€“ Summary & Reference

## 1. Kohaâ€™s Search Mechanism and Time Complexity

Koha uses the **Zebra search engine** as its default backend for handling bibliographic searches. Zebra is built on an **inverted index** structure, which means it tokenizes and stores words in a way that allows for **fast lookups**.

When a user issues a search query like `"electrical machines"`, Koha:
- Tokenizes the input
- Retrieves all matching records using its **prebuilt index** (no full-dataset scan)

Thanks to this indexing, the **time complexity** of Kohaâ€™s search is:
- **`O(log n)`**, where `n` is the number of records
- Highly **scalable**, even for **100,000+ book entries**

However, this native search:
- Works well for exact or close keyword matches
- **Lacks typo tolerance** and **intelligent reranking**

## 2. Zebra Indexing Overhead (One-Time Cost)

The process of building the Zebra index is a **one-time operation** that happens:
- When data is loaded or modified in Koha

During indexing:
- Koha tokenizes bibliographic entries
- Stores word mappings into its inverted index

### Time Complexity:
- **Indexing: `O(n)`** (linear)
- Not part of query-time performance, since the index is already built

> âš  This indexing overhead is **not counted** toward actual search latency.

## 3. Custom Fuzzy Matching with Python (RapidFuzz / Semantic Models)

Your custom backend implements **fuzzy** or **semantic reranking** using tools like:
- [`RapidFuzz`](https://github.com/maxbachmann/RapidFuzz)
- `sentence-transformers` (optional for semantic search)

It compares the query against the combined **Title + Author** field to:
- Calculate similarity scores
- Return contextually relevant matches â€” even with:
  - Typos
  - Word reordering
  - Partial queries

### Time Complexity:
- Full dataset: **`O(n)`** (inefficient at 50k+ scale)
- After Koha filtering (top 100 results): **`O(k * m)`**
  - `k` = number of top entries (e.g., 100)
  - `m` = average length of string being compared

## 4. Combining Both: Efficient & Scalable Hybrid Approach

The **optimal architecture** is a **hybrid search system**:

1. **Step 1** â€“ Kohaâ€™s Zebra API:
   - Fast indexed search
   - **Time: `O(log n)`**
   - Returns top `k` (~100) relevant results

2. **Step 2** â€“ Python Fuzzy Reranking:
   - Runs on `k` results
   - **Time: `O(k * m)`**
   - Adds typo tolerance and contextual accuracy

3. **(Optional)** â€“ Cache or NoSQL Storage:
   - Use `MongoDB` or local cache to prevent repeated API calls
   - Further improves performance for frequent queries

>  This system is **fast, intelligent, and scalable**

##  Final Conclusion

- **Kohaâ€™s native search** is fast and scalable but basic
  - It does **not handle typos**
  - Lacks smart ranking for vague queries

- **Custom fuzzy search** is intelligent but expensive when used alone
  - Becomes slow beyond 10k entries

-  **The hybrid system** combines:
  - **Kohaâ€™s speed (`O(log n)`)**
  - **Fuzzy reranking intelligence (`O(100 * m)`)**

### ðŸ”§ Production-Ready System
This approach creates a:
- **Typo-tolerant**
- **Context-aware**
- **Fast and scalable**
library search interface â€” suitable for real-world deployment.
